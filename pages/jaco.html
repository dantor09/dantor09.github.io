            <h2>Project objective</h2>
            <p>Jaco Oil has business in various markets. The market I was involved in was their vast network of gas convenience stores, Fastrip. The mission was to modernize and streamline our extensive network infrastructure. Prior to this upgrade, the backbone of the infrastructure was mostly legacy equipment and called for an overhaul.</p>

            <p>During this upgrade, I successfully configured 20 servers, each equipped with type 1 virtual machines (Bare metal virtual machines). These VM's ran Pfsense and Ubuntu software, ensuring great security insights into the network and an environment to process transactions. Additionally, I configured fortinet switches and Wifi access points to facilitate and segment various network devices.</p>

            <p>My role demanded a solid understanding of computer networking as security and proper communication is of prime importance. Before implementation, the server and devices were validated and tested in a lab environment. This validation step ensured our point of sale system was able to gather transaction data, access our local area network and external wide area network. This approach ensures that Jaco Oil remains up to date in current technologies and facilitates trouble shooting.</p>

            <h2>Overall architecture</h2>
            <p>To facilitate this data transfer, the organization employed a sophisticated SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system interfaced with OPC Data Access (OPC DA) protocol. This setup acted as a conduit, channeling all the telemetry data seamlessly into a centralized OPC DA server.</p>

            <h2>Powershell/SQL solution</h2>
            <p>Leveraging the versatility of PowerShell, I developed a robust script tailored to establish a remote connection to the OPCDA server. The script retrieved the csv data from the remote server. After retrievel, I implemented a data validation mechanism to sanitize and structure the data. Then, a secure database connection was instantiated, allowing for the integration of the telemetry data into our existing database infrastructure. This ensured our database tables were consistently updated with the latest telemetry insights, enhancing data accuracy and operational efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>After the script was made, documentation was a huge component of this project. Using flowchart conventions, this piece of documentation outlines the various paths the software can take. Most imporantly, it outlines what path the software should take on a successful run. Logging mechanism is also apparent in the documentation below.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>During this internship I learned a great deal of software development. I gathered requirements from my boss. Designed a high level solution, implemented, tested and maintained the software. This was a great experience and was the first time that I developed a piece of software for a company.This piece of software is still running, validating and transferring millions+ of telemetry points to various databases.</p>
